## Chemistry Trading Card Game (CTCG) - Extended Rules Document

## 1. Introduction

The **Chemistry Trading Card Game (CTCG)** is a competitive, educational card game where players utilize chemistry-based cards to engage in strategic gameplay. Players construct decks composed of **Elemental, Compound, Reaction, Catalyst, Scientist, and State Cards** to execute chemical reactions, build stable molecules, and outmaneuver opponents.

---

## 2. Game Setup

### 2.1 Deck Composition

Each player constructs a deck of **40-60 cards**, following these constraints:

- **Elemental Cards**: Minimum **10**
- **Compound Cards**: Minimum **5**
- **Reaction Cards**: Minimum **5**
- **Catalyst Cards**: Maximum **5**
- **Scientist Cards**: Maximum **2**
- **State Cards**: Maximum **3**
- No more than **4 copies of any card**.

### 2.2 Starting Setup

1. Each player shuffles their deck and draws **5 cards**.
2. Each player places **one Compound Card face-down** as their starting molecule.
3. A **coin flip** determines which player goes first.
4. Each player starts with **3 Energy**.

---

## 3. Turn Structure

Each turn consists of **four phases**:

### 3.1 Draw Phase

- The active player **draws 1 card** from their deck.

### 3.2 Elemental Phase

- The player may **play one Elemental Card** to generate energy.
- Elemental Cards remain on the field and **can be used to create Compounds**.

### 3.3 Action Phase

During this phase, players may:

1. **Play a Compound Card**
    
    - Requires Elemental Cards to meet **Energy Cost & Requirements**.
    - Compounds remain on the field and can participate in reactions.
2. **Activate a Reaction Card**
    
    - If requirements are met, the Reaction takes effect.
    - Example: _Combustion_ (Requires Hydrocarbon + O₂) causes **40 damage**.
3. **Use a Catalyst Card**
    
    - Reduces reaction costs or boosts effects.
    - Example: _Platinum Surface_ **halves Hydrogenation energy cost**.
4. **Activate a Scientist Card Ability**
    
    - Example: _Marie Curie_ allows free use of **radioactive elements**.
5. **Trigger a State Card** (Optional)
    
    - Introduces global conditions affecting gameplay.
    - Example: _Scorching Heat_ increases combustion damage but weakens stability.
6. **Attack an Opponent’s Compound**
    
    - A player may **attack a Compound** using an active **Reaction Card**.
    - Example: _Hydrochloric Acid_ **deals double damage to metal compounds**.
    - If Stability reaches **0**, the Compound is destroyed.

### 3.4 End Phase

- The player resolves **ongoing effects** (e.g., stability decay).
- The turn ends, and play passes to the opponent.

---

## 4. Card-Specific Mechanics

### 4.1 Elemental Cards

- Provide **Energy** to play Compound & Reaction Cards.
- Some **Elemental Cards have unique effects**, e.g., _Sodium_ explodes with water.

### 4.2 Compound Cards

- Require **specific elements** to be played.
- Have **Stability**, which can be **damaged, oxidized, or dissolved**.

### 4.3 Reaction Cards

- Trigger **chemical changes** and interactions.
- Example: _Oxidation-Reduction_ forms a metal oxide with **+2 Stability**.

### 4.4 Catalyst Cards

- Speed up reactions or **reduce energy costs**.
- Example: _Vanadium(V) Oxide_ **lowers oxidation reaction cost**.

### 4.5 Scientist Cards

- Grant unique **strategic advantages**.
- Example: _Dmitri Mendeleev_ allows **deck reorganization**.

### 4.6 State Cards

- Affect all players **until another State Card is played**.
- Example: _Extreme Pressure_ increases Stability but raises Reaction energy cost.

---

## 5. Energy System

- Players start with **3 Energy** and gain **+2 Energy per turn**.
- Energy is required to play **Compounds, Reactions, and some Special Cards**.
- Some cards provide **bonus energy generation** (e.g., _Photosynthesis_ grants +1 Energy per turn).

---

## 6. Attacking & Defense

- Each Compound has **Attack Power** and **Stability Value**.
- Attacks reduce the **Stability** of opposing molecules.
- If Stability reaches **0**, the molecule is **destroyed and discarded**.
- Some reactions **weaken Stability over time** (e.g., _Corrosion_ gradually reduces metal integrity).

---

## 7. Special Conditions & Rules

### 7.1 Chain Reactions

- Some Reactions **trigger additional effects**.
- Example: _Combustion_ creates **CO₂ and H₂O**, enabling further reactions.

### 7.2 Environmental Effects

- State Cards alter **global gameplay conditions**.
- Example: _Space Vacuum_ negates **Catalyst & Scientist effects** for one turn.

### 7.3 Compound Stability Boosts

- Some Compounds **gain extra Stability** when paired with certain elements.
- Example: _Calcium Carbonate_ **gains +1 Stability if an Acid is on the field**.

### 7.4 Deck-Out Rule

- If a player cannot draw a card at the start of their turn, they **lose the game**.

---

## 8. Win Conditions

A player wins by achieving **one of the following**:

1. **Destroy all of the opponent’s Compound Cards**.
2. **Reach a scientific goal**, such as completing a chain of reactions.
3. **Reduce the opponent’s deck to zero**.

---

## 9. Game Variants

### 9.1 Team Play (2v2 Mode)

- Each team has **two players**, sharing a combined field.
- Team members **alternate turns** and can support each other with Elemental Cards.

### 9.2 Scientific Experiment Mode

- Players **aim to synthesize specific compounds**.
- The first player to create the full reaction chain **wins the game**.

---

## 10. Game Engine Integration

- The game engine now includes **automated energy tracking**.
- Players can execute **combustion, oxidation, and other reactions** based on element availability.
- **State Cards modify the game dynamically**.
- The AI opponent is updated to **strategically play Scientist and Catalyst cards**.

---

## 11. Conclusion

CTCG merges **fun, strategy, and education** into an engaging experience. By combining **deck-building, reaction planning, and scientific principles**, players deepen their understanding of chemistry while enjoying dynamic gameplay.
